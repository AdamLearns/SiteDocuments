Last update: March 29, 2020 ([version history](https://github.com/AdamLearns/SiteDocuments/commits/master/privacy.md))

**Adam Learns** and **The AcAdamy** ("the site" or "the sites") are owned by **Xtonomous LLC** ("XTONOMOUS", "we", "us", "our") and operated by XTONOMOUS and its affiliates. We may be contacted via email at [adam@adamlearns.live](mailto:adam@adamlearns.live).

The **Privacy Policy** ("this document") describes how we handle your information: what information we collect, what we do with it, who gets access to it, and mechanisms in place for you to update and/or remove information.

This document may be updated from time to time. Your use of the Services indicates your agreement to the current terms.

## Your Consent and Use of Services

By accessing, logging into, or interacting with the Services, you are consenting to the terms of the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access the Services.

## Information we collect

1. **Authentication Information**: this includes but is not limited to an email/password combination or an OpenID provider like Google, Twitter, Twitch, or Patreon.
2. **Device Information**: we may have access to device-specific information such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and IP addresses.
3. **Personal Information**: this includes email address, username, and password as mentioned by Authentication Information.
4. **Metrics Information**: this includes which parts of the Services you use and how long you use them for.
5. **OpenID Information**: when you choose to connect with certain identity providers (e.g. Twitch or Twitter), we may pull in information from this third party, e.g. your ID with that provider and/or the list of channels/users that you follow.

## How we use information that we collect

We use the information we collect from all of our Services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Services, and to protect us and our users. When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication as well as the other information in this Privacy Policy to help solve any issues you might be facing.

1. **Authentication Information**: this is used to identify who you are for the sake of providing an Account.
2. **Device Information**: this is used to provide features of the Services (e.g. serving a mobile page when you access from a mobile device), prevent exploitation of the services (e.g. analyzing abuse based on IP addresses), and to improve the services (e.g. to contextualize Metrics Information (see below)).
3. **Personal Information**: with your consent, we may use your email address to inform you about our Services. We may also email you transactionally, e.g. with verification emails or password-reset emails.
4. **Metrics Information**: this is used to improve the services, e.g. to identify where features of the site can be made more accessible.
5. **OpenID Information**: this is used for integration with other sites where Adam Learns has a presence. For example, a reward may be granted or access to a feature may be unlocked by people who follow on Twitch, YouTube, Patreon, or Twitter.

Please keep in mind that comments sections, forums, and other similar areas of our Services are public. Any information posted in those areas is viewable and usable by anyone that has access.

### Consent

We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. Consent can be revoked at any time, typically through the Services itself, but otherwise by emailing [adam@adamlearns.live](mailto:adam@adamlearns.live).

For necessary functionality such as authentication, consent can only be revoked by deleting your account entirely.

## Cookie Policy

Cookies are used to authenticate your account (i.e. they are session cookies and are required for Account-based functionality of the Services). These cookies persist for up to two weeks. They can be cleared by logging out.

This authentication data is shared with only one third party: Google Firebase, the underlying authentication system behind the Services.

Some third parties may also use cookies. For more information, see the "Third-party operators and services" section. To allow these, you must opt in to using them. [You change your settings at any time here](/cookies). If you opt out of cookies there, you are responsible for the deletion of the cookies.

Note: this cookie policy generally addresses other forms of local storage as well (e.g. the browser's `localStorage` or IndexedDB). Some information may be stored solely to allow operation of the site.

## Third-party operators and services

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on the Services. We also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites, including social networks.

For further information, please see the relevant privacy policies for each Third Party Operator:

- Google
  - Google Fonts<sup>1</sup>: the Services make use of Google Fonts
  - Google Analytics<sup>2</sup>: the Services use Google Analytics to collect aggregate information on session length, traffic sources, and user behavior patterns within the Services. Ad personalization is not enabled, and IP addresses are anonymized.
  - Google Firebase<sup>3</sup>: the Services are run on Google Firebase. This includes site hosting, data storage, and authentication.
- Paddle
  - Paddle's payment platform<sup>4</sup>: the Services make use of Paddle as a payment platform.

  - Paddle uses cookies to improve their site and for marketing activities<sup>4</sup>. Because Paddle uses them for marketing activities, we ask for your consent to use these cookies before allowing you to make a purchase. You are able to revoke this consent at any time through the Account page.
- Identity providers (e.g. Google, Twitter, Twitch)
  - When you log in using another site as an identity provider, you are actually going _through_ their site, at which point you are subject to their privacy policies. Please look up the privacy policy for these individual sites to find out more about how they treat your data.

## Accessing and updating your personal information

You have the right to retrieve, update, and remove your personal information from our databases. If you have any problems or questions, please let us know by contacting us at [adam@adamlearns.live](mailto:adam@adamlearns.live) and we will assist you with the process. If the question pertains to personal information, then you must email us from the address that we have on file, that way we can verify your identity before acting on the request.

You can update your personal information from the Account page on the site. This includes your email address, any consent you may have given us (e.g. the consent to email you or to utilize certain cookies). You can also delete your account from here.

We do not allow changing or removing information in cases of legitimate business or legal purposes. For example, if your account is banned from the Services, we will still process your account deletion, but we may retain your email address to prevent future registrations.

## Information we share

We do not share personal information with companies, outside organizations, or individuals unless one of the following circumstances apply:

1. With your consent: we will share personal information with companies, outside organizations or individuals if we have your consent to do so.
2. For external processing: we provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. Our Services are hosted on Google Firebase.
3. For legal reasons: we will share personal information with companies, outside organizations, or individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
4. In case of a sale or asset transfer: if we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of our Services, could be included in the transferred assets. Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Services.
5. In aggregated form for business purposes: we may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners such as businesses we have a relationship with, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information to show trends about the general use of our services.

## Information security

We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. However no website or storage system is entirely secure, and as such we can make no guarantee for the safety of your information stored in associated with the Services. You should protect the account information in your possession as well.

## Enforcement

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up.

Our Services are not directed toward children under 13 and we will not knowingly collect information for any child under the age of 13. If you are the parent of a child under the age of 13 and have a concern regarding your child’s information on our Services, please contact us at [adam@adamlearns.live](mailto:adam@adamlearns.live).

## Our Services are Located in the United States

Our Services are hosted in the United States. If you are outside of the United States, your information will be processed and stored in the United States and you are consenting to such processing and storage.

## General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)

We strive to make the Services GDPR-compliant. As such, most actions around personal information (updating, retrieval, and deletion) can be performed directly via the Services themselves. Where absent, these actions can be performed by contacting us at [adam@adamlearns.live](mailto:adam@adamlearns.live).

Database backups are taken regularly and automatically. Backups are retained for 30 days. These backups may contain your personal information that could since have been updated or removed. In these cases, care will be taken to re-apply any deletions or changes to the database when restoring from a backup.

## Changes

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain Services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
